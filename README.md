# About me 

Hi! My name is Tina and I am a spanish second year student of multi-platform application development 👩‍🎓. Currently working on learning new languages and improving my skills.

Before I started this coding journey, I worked as an EN>ES audiovisual translator, which has little to do with coding, but here we are... 

I guess I am a passionate for all kind of languages 🤓
